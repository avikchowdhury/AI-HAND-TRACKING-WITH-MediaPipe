# AI HAND TRACKING WITH MediaPipe
 AI Hand tracking with MediaPipe andDetect Left and Right Hand also with Calculate Angles
In this project you'll learn how to wield OpenCV and Python to get the most out of the Hand Pose estimation model from MediaPipe. You'll be able to leverage the in built model to detect whether a hand is a left hand or a right hand as well as leveraging NumPy to calculate joint angles for kinematic analysis.

In this project we will learn how to:
1. Detect Left and Right hands from Hand Poses usingn Mediapipe
2. Calculating Angles for Hand Joints Using Numpy
3. Rendering Estimated Detections using OpenCV
